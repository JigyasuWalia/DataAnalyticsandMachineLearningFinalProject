# Research Question :
Can we use the information from these clients who received a phone call or an email to
create a model that explains the success of a contact, such as whether a client would
purchase health insurance?
# Research Goal :
Using the Logical Regression, the classification goal is to obtain rules and forecast if a
client will agree to get a health insurance policy or not.
Using this model, We hope to improve campaign efficiency by identifying the primary criteria
that influence success (client subscribing to health insurance following call or email) and
having a more rational estimate of which client is a high-quality potential buying customer that
we should contact first.
